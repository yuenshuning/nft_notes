## 6. HashLips NFT

1. Mint an NFT for free on [Mintable.app](https://mintable.app/). Aother website called [opensea]() is more popular but it's not possible to sell for free.

2. How to create an NFT collection

   - [HashLips Art Engine](https://github.com/HashLips/hashlips_art_engine) Code description

      - `layers/`: basic assets of image generation and fusion

      - `src/config.js`: configuration of image generation. The `layersOrder` object describes the order of generative images (the order matters), where the values of key-value pairs <u>should correspond to</u> the folder name of `layers/` one by one

      - If we want to set the rarity of layers, set the file name of layers as `xxx#weight.png`, otherwise, the weight is equal to default weight (1). The one with the smallest weight is the rarest. See `src/main.js/getRarityWeight`

      - If we want to run two or more different configurations at the same time, we need to grow the amount of `growEditionSizeTo`

         ```js
         const layerConfigurations = [
           {
             // 5 eye images
             growEditionSizeTo: 5,
             layersOrder: [ { name: "Background" }, { name: "Eyeball" }, { name: "Eye color" }, { name: "Iris" }, { name: "Shine" }, { name: "Bottom lid" }, { name: "Top lid" } ]
           }, {
             // 3 bear images
             growEditionSizeTo: 8,
             layersOrder: [ { name: "bear_background" }, { name: "bear_body" }, { name: "bear_clothes" }, { name: "bear_hair" } ]
           }
         ];
         ```

      - If we want to change the image baseUri from defalut `ipfs://NewUriToReplace` to other value, change the `baseUri` in `src/config.js`

      - Customize the description of each image by changing the `description` in `src/config.js`

      - Shuffle the generated images by setting the `shuffleLayerConfigurations` in `src/config.js` to `true`

      - Resize the size of generated images by changing the `format` in `src/config.js`

      - Setting a base color as background by setting the `background` in `src/config.js`

      - Run `node index.js` to generate images according to `src/config.js` and `layers/` assets.

      - Run `node utils/xxx.js` to use the utils

      - The generative images and corresponding JSON files (metadata) locate in `build/`

   - Metadata is neccessary, because metadata is the information of a particular image. It's in the format of JSON object. That is why we generate images with JSON files.

   - Upload our generated images (JSON files cannot be uploaded) to [pinata](https://app.pinata.cloud/) ipfs hosting server, and get an unique image CID. Go to `src/config.js`, change the `baseUri` to `ipfs://{image CID}`, run `node utils/update_info.js` to <u>only</u> update the JSON files (do not re-generate images)

   - Upload our generated JSON files to [pinata](https://app.pinata.cloud/) ipfs hosting server, and get an unique metadata CID.

   - Upload our hidden_image and hidden_metadata the same way, and get unique hidden_image CID and hidden_metadata CID.

   - [HashLips NFT Contract](https://github.com/HashLips/hashlips_nft_contract) Code description

      - Change the `maxSupply` in `SimpleNft_flat.sol` to the amount of images we generated
      - Change other variables such as `cost`, `maxMintAmount`, `paused`, `revealed`
      - make sure the solidity compile matches the pragma
      - make sure we are on `Injected Web3` environment
      - configure the Metamask and choose test net (rinkeby). Then Remember the id under the `Injected Web3` environment shown on remix, which should look like `Custom (4) network`
      - make sure we choose the right contract on remix to deploy (Bear.sol) and set parameters. Note:
         - the `_initBaseURI` should be `ipfs://{metadata CID}/`. Such as `ipfs://QmdVXTnbXPLBk5JjiXcZCyS6z42ugEh8265apaa7LACW4F/`
         - the `_initNotRevealedUri` should be `ipfs://{hidden_metadata CID}/hidden.json`. Such as `ipfs://QmdwkKuAkgx2CBUMGYJMp68kiJwEYU6dhcGT2KC7G71HWL/hidden.json`
      - Before click the `transact` button, click the small `copy` icon left to it, and save the information to local .txt file. We need this information to verify the contract.
      - Then click the `transact` button to deploy the contract. When deployed, call the `pause` function on remix and change `pause` to `false`. Set value from `0 wei` to `cost`
      - Click the small `copy` button icon of `Deployed Contracts` and save the information to local .txt file.
      - Click the `mint`, `reveal` (show the real images rather than the hidden image) and other functions to have a try.
      - Then go to OpenSea. Not the normal OpenSea, but the [testnets OpenSea](https://testnets.opensea.io/) the normal OpenSea only show the items on network with `id=1` which is the main net. We can see the hidden_bear on OpenSea testnet (if the OpenSea is delayed, try refreshing).
   
   - [HashLips NFT Minting Dapp](https://github.com/HashLips/hashlips_nft_minting_dapp) Code description

      - Set up: run `npm i` to install the dependency
      - Run locally: run `npm run start`
      - Packup and prepare for deployment: run `npm run build`. If the website deployed on server has some failed images, change the access permission of the images.
      - `public/config/images`: basic assets/images
      - `public/config/theme.css`: global css style
      - `public/config/config.js`:  we need to change the configure according to our deployed contract, the `CONTRACT_ADDRESS`, `NETWORK.ID` and so on. The network id of ethereum main net is `1`, the id of polygon is `137`
      - `public/config/abi.json`: we need to copy our contract's abi from remix (at the bottom of compiler page, a small icon named ABI) or truffle (?) to here
   
3. How HashLips NFTs are made

   - The price of a HashLip is determined by the edition number and the rarity

4. Upload a website/10000 NFTs to IPFS

   - IPFS, InterPlanetary File System is a network transmission protocol for distributed storage
   - We can use [Pinata](https://app.pinata.cloud/pinmanager) to upload and manage files on IPFS, or use [NFT Storage](https://nft.storage/) to upload files with APIs
   - OpenSea is a NFT marketplace, it has a [Metadata Standards](https://docs.opensea.io/docs/metadata-standards) describing how metadata should be structed. We can change the basic information of our basic collection by click the `edit` icon on collection page

5. Reveal NFT metadata on a smart contract

   - We want to hide the true metadata and image to users. So we create a hidden image and hidden json, and set a bool variable named `revealed` on the smart contract. The `revealed` flag determines whether we return the true metadata or hidden metadata
   - Other users buy NFTs and send ether to contract address. Then only the owner of contract can call the `withdraw` function and withdraw ether from the contract address to owner's account address

6. [HashLips Art Engine](https://github.com/HashLips/hashlips_art_engine) Code review

   - This repo can turn image layers into thousands of uniquely code generated artworks (images and JSON files)

   - How to configure the rarity. Weighted Random Choices. 1) Set the file name of layers as `xxx#weight.png`, otherwise, the weight is equal to default 1, see `src/main.js/getElements()` and `src/main.js/getRarityWeight()`; 2) Use weighted random choice to return selected layer element, see `src/main.js/createDna()`; 3) Add metadata, where the dna is compressed by `sha1()`

   - blending modes: how two layers are blended with each other, such as hard mix, linear light, soft light, etc. Also, canvas API provides many blending modes (globalCompositeOperation), such as source-over, destination over, etc. Configure the blending modes in `src/config.js`

     ```js
     const layerConfigurations = [{
         growEditionSizeTo: 3,
         layersOrder: [
           { name: "Background" },
           { name: "Eyeball" },
           { name: "Eye color", options: { blend: MODE.color } },
           { name: "Iris" },
           { name: "Shine" },
           { name: "Bottom lid",
            	options: {
                 blend: MODE.multiply,	// blending mode
                 opacity: 0.5,			// opacity
                 // show "myLayerName" in the metadata JSON file rather than "Bottom lid"
                 displayName: "myLayerName"
             }
           },
           { name: "Top lid" }
         ],
     }]
     ```

   - Run directly `node utils/update_info.js` to only update the metadata JSON files without changing the images.

   - Run directly `node utils/pixelate.js` to convert images to pixel style. Set `pixelFormat` in `src/config.js` to change pixelation degree.

   - Run directly `node utils/preview.js` or `node utils/preview` to generate preview image or .gif

   - Run directly `node utils/generate_metadata` for existed images and console their rgb information. Based on the static rgb and tolerance, we can classify the existed images into "this image is a hot dog" or "this is not a hot dog"

   - Setting `debugLogs=true` in `src/config.js` can print logs to terminal

   - Setting `extraMetadata={artist: 'me'}` in `src/config.js` can add extra metadata to JSON files

   - Setting `text: {only: true}` in `src/config.js` to only draw images with layer information in text.

   - Setting `network=NETWORK.xxx` to generate JSON files for other blockchain structures

   - Setting `gif={export: true}` to generate .gif dynamic graphs.

   - Use npm scripts to simplify the code execution, like `npm run update_info`. See more in `src/package.json`

7. Generate names

   - Run `run init -y`

   - Write `config.js`

     ```js
     const names = ["name1", "name2", "name3"];
     const middleNamed = ["midName1", "midName2", "midName3"];
     const surnames = ["surName1", "surName2", "surName3"];
     module.exports = {names, middleNamed, surnames};
     ```

   - Write `index.js`

     ```js
     const {names, middleNamed, surnames} = require("./config");
     const format = [names, middleNamed, surnames];
     const create = () => {
         let output = [];
         format.forEach((list) => {
             let word = list[Math.floor(Math.random()*list.length)];
             output.push(word);
         });
         return output.join(" ");
     }
     // console.log(create());
     console.table({name: create()});
     ```
