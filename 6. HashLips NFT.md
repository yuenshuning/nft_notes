## 6. HashLips NFT

1. Basic knowledge

   - Ethereum accounts can be divided into two types: 1) Externally owned account, EOA. private key -> public key -> public address (identifier); 2) contract account. contract address
   - Deployment of contract account costs storage on blockchain networks, thus needs gas
   - Transactions can be initiated only by EOA. Contract account can respond to transactions
   - Transaction Lifecycle:
     - Once we send a atransaction, cryptography generates a transaction hash
     - The transaction is then broadcast to the network and included in a pool with lots of other transactions
     - A miner must pick our transaction and included it in a block in order to verify the transaction and consider it "successful"
     - Our transaction will get a block confirmation number, means our transaction is included in
   - IPFS's storage is finite, so nodes need to clear out some previous resources to make room for new resources. This process is called garbage collection.

2. Mint an NFT for free on [Mintable.app](https://mintable.app/). Another website called [opensea]() is more popular but it's not possible to sell for free.

3. How to create an NFT collection

   - [HashLips Art Engine](https://github.com/HashLips/hashlips_art_engine) Code description

      - `layers/`: basic assets of image generation and fusion

      - `src/config.js`: configuration of image generation. The `layersOrder` object describes the order of generative images (the order matters), where the values of key-value pairs <u>should correspond to</u> the folder name of `layers/` one by one

      - If we want to set the rarity of layers, set the file name of layers as `xxx#weight.png`, otherwise, the weight is equal to default weight (1). The one with the smallest weight is the rarest. See `src/main.js/getRarityWeight`

      - If we want to run two or more different configurations at the same time, we need to grow the amount of `growEditionSizeTo`

         ```js
         const layerConfigurations = [
           {
             // 5 eye images
             growEditionSizeTo: 5,
             layersOrder: [ { name: "Background" }, { name: "Eyeball" }, { name: "Eye color" }, { name: "Iris" }, { name: "Shine" }, { name: "Bottom lid" }, { name: "Top lid" } ]
           }, {
             // 3 bear images
             growEditionSizeTo: 8,
             layersOrder: [ { name: "bear_background" }, { name: "bear_body" }, { name: "bear_clothes" }, { name: "bear_hair" } ]
           }
         ];
         ```

      - If we want to change the image baseUri from defalut `ipfs://NewUriToReplace` to other value, change the `baseUri` in `src/config.js`

      - Customize the description of each image by changing the `description` in `src/config.js`

      - Shuffle the generated images by setting the `shuffleLayerConfigurations` in `src/config.js` to `true`

      - Resize the size of generated images by changing the `format` in `src/config.js`

      - Setting a base color as background by setting the `background` in `src/config.js`

      - Run `node index.js` to generate images according to `src/config.js` and `layers/` assets.

      - Run `node utils/xxx.js` to use the utils

      - The generative images and corresponding JSON files (metadata) locate in `build/`

   - Metadata is neccessary, because metadata is the information of a particular image. It's in the format of JSON object. That is why we generate images with JSON files.

   - Upload our generated images (JSON files cannot be uploaded) to [pinata](https://app.pinata.cloud/) ipfs hosting server, and get an unique image CID. Go to `src/config.js`, change the `baseUri` to `ipfs://{image CID}`, run `node utils/update_info.js` to <u>only</u> update the JSON files (do not re-generate images)

   - Upload our generated JSON files to [pinata](https://app.pinata.cloud/) ipfs hosting server, and get an unique metadata CID.

   - Upload our hidden_image and hidden_metadata the same way, and get unique hidden_image CID and hidden_metadata CID.

   - [HashLips NFT Contract](https://github.com/HashLips/hashlips_nft_contract) Code description

      - Change the `maxSupply` in `SimpleNft_flat.sol` to the amount of images we generated
      - Change other variables such as `cost`, `maxMintAmount`, `paused`, `revealed`
      - make sure the solidity compile matches the pragma
      - make sure we are on `Injected Web3` environment
      - configure the Metamask and choose test net (rinkeby). Then Remember the id under the `Injected Web3` environment shown on remix, which should look like `Custom (4) network`
      - make sure we choose the right contract on remix to deploy (Bear.sol) and set parameters. Note:
         - the `_initBaseURI` should be `ipfs://{metadata CID}/`. Such as `ipfs://QmdVXTnbXPLBk5JjiXcZCyS6z42ugEh8265apaa7LACW4F/`
         - the `_initNotRevealedUri` should be `ipfs://{hidden_metadata CID}/hidden.json`. Such as `ipfs://QmdwkKuAkgx2CBUMGYJMp68kiJwEYU6dhcGT2KC7G71HWL/hidden.json`
      - Before click the `transact` button, click the small `copy` icon left to it, and save the information to local .txt file. We need this information to verify the contract.
      - Then click the `transact` button to deploy the contract. When deployed, call the `pause` function on remix and change `pause` to `false`. Set value from `0 wei` to `cost`
      - Click the small `copy` button icon of `Deployed Contracts` and save the information to local .txt file.
      - Click the `mint`, `reveal` (show the real images rather than the hidden image) and other functions to have a try.
      - Then go to OpenSea. Not the normal OpenSea, but the [testnets OpenSea](https://testnets.opensea.io/) the normal OpenSea only show the items on network with `id=1` which is the main net. We can see the hidden_bear on OpenSea testnet (if the OpenSea is delayed, try refreshing).

   - [HashLips NFT Minting Dapp](https://github.com/HashLips/hashlips_nft_minting_dapp) Code description

      - Set up: run `npm i` to install the dependency
      - Run locally: run `npm run start`
      - Packup and prepare for deployment: run `npm run build`. If the website deployed on server has some failed images, change the access permission of the images.
      - `public/config/images`: basic assets/images
      - `public/config/theme.css`: global css style
      - `public/config/config.js`:  we need to change the configure according to our deployed contract, the `CONTRACT_ADDRESS`, `NETWORK.ID` and so on. The network id of ethereum main net is `1`, the id of polygon is `137`
      - `public/config/abi.json`: we need to copy our contract's abi from remix (at the bottom of compiler page, a small icon named ABI) or truffle (?) to here

4. How HashLips NFTs are made

   - The price of a HashLip is determined by the edition number and the rarity

5. Upload a website/10000 NFTs to IPFS

   - IPFS, InterPlanetary File System is a network transmission protocol for distributed storage
   - We can use [Pinata](https://app.pinata.cloud/pinmanager) to upload and manage files on IPFS, or use [NFT Storage](https://nft.storage/) to upload files with APIs
   - OpenSea is a NFT marketplace, it has a [Metadata Standards](https://docs.opensea.io/docs/metadata-standards) describing how metadata should be structed. We can change the basic information of our basic collection by click the `edit` icon on collection page

6. Reveal NFT metadata on a smart contract

   - We want to hide the true metadata and image to users. So we create a hidden image and hidden json, and set a bool variable named `revealed` on the smart contract. The `revealed` flag determines whether we return the true metadata or hidden metadata
   - Other users buy NFTs and send ether to contract address. Then only the owner of contract can call the `withdraw` function and withdraw ether from the contract address to owner's account address

7. [HashLips Art Engine](https://github.com/HashLips/hashlips_art_engine) Code review

   - This repo can turn image layers into thousands of uniquely code generated artworks (images and JSON files)

   - How to configure the rarity. Weighted Random Choices. 1) Set the file name of layers as `xxx#weight.png`, otherwise, the weight is equal to default 1, see `src/main.js/getElements()` and `src/main.js/getRarityWeight()`; 2) Use weighted random choice to return selected layer element, see `src/main.js/createDna()`; 3) Add metadata, where the dna is compressed by `sha1()`

   - blending modes: how two layers are blended with each other, such as hard mix, linear light, soft light, etc. Also, canvas API provides many blending modes (globalCompositeOperation), such as source-over, destination over, etc. Configure the blending modes in `src/config.js`

     ```js
     const layerConfigurations = [{
         growEditionSizeTo: 3,
         layersOrder: [
           { name: "Background" },
           { name: "Eyeball" },
           { name: "Eye color", options: { blend: MODE.color } },
           { name: "Iris" },
           { name: "Shine" },
           { name: "Bottom lid",
            	options: {
                 blend: MODE.multiply,	// blending mode
                 opacity: 0.5,			// opacity
                 // show "myLayerName" in the metadata JSON file rather than "Bottom lid"
                 displayName: "myLayerName"
             }
           },
           { name: "Top lid" }
         ],
     }]
     ```

   - Run directly `node utils/update_info.js` to only update the metadata JSON files without changing the images.

   - Run directly `node utils/pixelate.js` to convert images to pixel style. Set `pixelFormat` in `src/config.js` to change pixelation degree.

   - Run directly `node utils/preview.js` or `node utils/preview` to generate preview image or .gif

   - Run directly `node utils/generate_metadata` for existed images and console their rgb information. Based on the static rgb and tolerance, we can classify the existed images into "this image is a hot dog" or "this is not a hot dog"

   - Setting `debugLogs=true` in `src/config.js` can print logs to terminal

   - Setting `extraMetadata={artist: 'me'}` in `src/config.js` can add extra metadata to JSON files

   - Setting `text: {only: true}` in `src/config.js` to only draw images with layer information in text.

   - Setting `network=NETWORK.xxx` to generate JSON files for other blockchain structures

   - Setting `gif={export: true}` to generate .gif dynamic graphs.

   - Use npm scripts to simplify the code execution, like `npm run update_info`. See more in `src/package.json`

8. [Solidity] Code a 10000 NFT Minting Dapp

   - [Host servers](https://www.afrihost.com/) is a better choice than [IPFS](https://app.pinata.cloud/) of storing thousands of images, so that we don't need CID. We first zip all the JSON files and images, upload it to file manager, and extract the .zip file, and change the access permission of files

   - [HashLips NFT Contract](https://github.com/HashLips/hashlips_nft_contract) Code review

     - `uint256 maxSupply`: total amount of mintable NFTs
     - `uint256 maxMintAmount`: maximum amount of NFTs one user can mint at one time
     - `constructor()`: the owner deploy the contract
     - `mint()`: if the owner call this function, the owner need not to send value. If someone else calls this function, he need to set `msg.value` when calling. We can also change the logic as needed
     - `tokenURI()`: according to [OpenSea Documentation](https://docs.opensea.io/docs/1-structuring-your-smart-contract), NFT minter should return a unique url for NFT. The url points to the metadata JSON file
     - `safeTransferFrom(from,to,tokenId)`: transfer NFT from one address to another address
     - `tokenURI(tokenId)`: return the metadata JSON file storage address of tokenId, if tokenId exists
     - `withdraw()`: only the owner of the contract can call this function. When other users buy NFTs, ether will be sent to contract address. The contract owner call the `withdraw()` and withdraw all the ether from the contract address to owner's account address
     - `pause(_state)`: only the owner of the contract can call this function. Set the state of contract to `_state` (true/false -> paused/running)

   - How to generate random number with Solidity? with `keccak256`

     ```solidity
     function randomNumer(uint256 _mod, uint256 _seed, uint256 _salt) public view returns(uint256) {
     	uint256 num = uint256(keccak256(abi.encodePacked(block.timestamp, msg.sender, _seed, _salt))) % _mod;
     	return num;
     }
     ```

   - Improvement: minting NFTs with rewards

     ```solidity
     function mint() public payable {
     	uint256 supply = totallySupply();
     	require(!paused);
     	require(supply + 1 <= maxSupply);
     	require(msg.sender != owner());
     	require(msg.value >= cost);
     	address payable giftAddress = payable(msg.sender);
     	uint giftValue = 0;
     	// randomly select a owner (not necessarily the msg.sender), give he rewards
     	if(supply>0) {
     		giftAddress = payable(ownerOf(randomNumer(supply, block.timestamp, supply+1)+1));
     		giftValue = mag.value*10/100;
     	}
     	_safeMint(msg.sender, supply+1);
     	// pay the rewards
     	if(supply>0) {
     		(bool success, ) = payable(giftAddress).call{value: giftValue}("");
     		require(success);
     	}
     }
     ```

   - If we only use remix to do self-test, we can choose the remix ENVIRONMENT as `JavaScript VM`, but if we want to deploy our contract to Rinkeby test net, we need to choose ENVIRONMENT as `Inject Web3` and according connect our MetaMask to Rinkeby Test Network (get test ether of Rinkeby through [here](https://faucets.chain.link/rinkeby))

   - Then we can play with our contract, mint some NFTs and come to [testnets OpenSea](https://testnets.opensea.io/) to view our NFT collections. Or we can fetch the NFT collection information through [OpenSea TestNets API](https://testnets-api.opensea.io/api/v1/asset/<your_contract_address>/<token_id>/?force_update=true). Refer to the [OpenSea document](https://docs.opensea.io/docs/3-viewing-your-items-on-opensea)

9. [JS] Code a NFT Minting Dapp from A-Z on Polygon network

   - How to create layer material for `hashlips-art-engine`: in PhotoShop, draw different elements in dependent layers, click file -> export -> Layers to Files
   - Strategy of setting the rarity of generative images
     - set increasing weight for each element, such as 1, 5, 50 and 100 (the weight of the last element must be 100), then randomly generate a random number of [1,100]. If the random number is 45, 45 is within the range of [5,50], then the 3nd element is selected. In other words, the probability of each element selected is `1`, `5-1=4`, `50-5=45` and `100-50=50` respectively
     - set weights for each element, such as 50, 60, 80, 5, then randomly generate a random number of [1,195]. If the random number is 55, 55 is within the range of [50,110], then the 2rd element is selected. In other words, the probability of each element selected is `50`, `60`, `80` and `5` respectively
   - Polygon: verify the contracts? The ABI-encoded constructor arguments are the long hexadecimal number we copied from Remix before clicking `deploy`. The last part of the hexadecimal number with many zeros is the arguments. See more [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U4a_-WCtjYY&list=PLvfQp12V0hS1aYCrU5CziyxKxie6OPPPS&index=3)

10. [FrontEnd] Code a NFT minter Dapp using IPFS ([user-drawn images](https://github.com/HashLips/frontend_base_dapp)) code review

    - `src/contracts/redux/blockchain`: map-reduce of blockchain operation, such as connecting, minting, changing account, changing network

    - `src/styles/globalStyles.js`: use `styled-components` to predefine some styled `div` or `p`. Then `src/App.js` can use these styled components (still can add attributes) as:

      ```js
      // src/styles/globalStyles.js
      export const TextSubTitle = styled.p`
        font-size: 18px;
        line-height: 1.6;
      `;
      export const Container = styled.div`
        height: 16px;
        width: 16px;
      `;
      // src/App.js
      <s.Container style={{padding: 24}}><s.TextSubTitle /></s.Container>
      ```

    - `import SignatureCanvas from 'react-signature-canvas'`:  interactive canvas drawing component. If we don't use code to generate images, users can draw and mint their own images

    - `import {create} from 'ipfs-http-client'`: upload user-drawn images to IPFS, get the image url, construct metadata

      ```js
      const ipfsClient = create("https://ipfs.infura.io:5001/api/v0");
      const ipfsBaseUrl = "https://ipfs.infura.io/ipfs/";
      const addedImgae = await ipfsClient.add(_imgBuffer);
      const metaDataObj = {
          name: 'name',
          descript: 'des',
          image: ipfsBaseUrl+addedImgae.path
      }
      const addedMetaData = await ipfsClient.add(JSON.stringify(metaDataObj));
      ```

    - Now, we have get the url of image and JSON metadata, we are going to call the blockchain function and mint it.

      ```js
      const mint = (_url) => {
          blockchian.smartContract.methods
              .mint(blockchain.account, _url)
              .send({from: blockchain.account})
              .once("error", (err)=>{...})
              .then((receipt)=>{...})
      }
      ```

11. [FrontEnd] Create an NFT drop listing dapp

    - TODO

12. Generate names

    - Run `run init -y`

    - Write `config.js`

      ```js
      const names = ["name1", "name2", "name3"];
      const middleNamed = ["midName1", "midName2", "midName3"];
      const surnames = ["surName1", "surName2", "surName3"];
      module.exports = {names, middleNamed, surnames};
      ```

    - Write `index.js`

      ```js
      const {names, middleNamed, surnames} = require("./config");
      const format = [names, middleNamed, surnames];
      const create = () => {
          let output = [];
          format.forEach((list) => {
              let word = list[Math.floor(Math.random()*list.length)];
              output.push(word);
          });
          return output.join(" ");
      }
      // console.log(create());
      console.table({name: create()});
      ```
