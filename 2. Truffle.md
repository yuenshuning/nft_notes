#### Lesson 5 of Solidity

1. Token

   - Token is smart contract that implements a standard set of functions that all other token contracts share, e.g.,  ERC20, ERC721 standard

     ```solidity
     contract Zombie is ERC721 {...}
     ```

2. Multiple Inheritance

   ```solidity
   // separate multiple inherited contracts with a comma ','
   contract SatoshiNakamoto is NickSzabo, HalFinney {...}
   ```

3. Duplicate Name and Refactoring

   - Compiler will give an error if a modifier and a function with the same name. Need refactoring.

4. Logical operator

   - or: ||

5. Security Issue

   - Users accidentally transfer tokens to address `0`, which is unrecoverable and called "burning a token"
   - Preventing Overflows and Underflows: use `SafeMath` library

6. Libaray

   - What is Library: A library is a special type of contract in Solidity, declared with keyword `library` rather than `contract`, containing some functions. One of the things it is useful for is to attach functions to native data types.

   - With `using XXX for xxx`, all of the library's methods are automatically tacked on to another <u>data type</u>. And the data type calling the method will be automatically passed in as the first argument of the method.

      ```solidity
      library SafeMath {
        function add(uint256 a, uint256 b) internal pure returns (uint256) {...}
      }
      
      // usage syntax of library
      contract xxx {
          using SafeMath for uint256;
          uint256 a = 5;
          // add() requires two parameters, 'a' is automatically passed as the first param, and '3' is the second param
          uint256 b = a.add(3);
      }
      ```

   - How does `SafeMath` protect security? The functions of `SafeMath` use `assert` to prevent operations from overflows and underflows.

      ```solidity
      function add(uint256 a, uint256 b) internal pure returns (uint256) {
        uint256 c = a + b;
        assert(c >= a);
        return c;
      }
      // Thus, replace ++ with SafeMath method
      ownerZombieCount[_to]++;
      ownerZombieCount[_to] = ownerZombieCount[_to].add(1);
      ```

   - `assert`is similar to `require`, where it will throw an error if false. The difference between them is that `require` will <u>refund</u> the user the rest of their gas when a function fails, whereas `assert` will not. So most of the time you want to use `require` in your code; `assert` is typically used when something has gone horribly wrong with the code (like a `uint` overflow).

   - Knowing that `using library` is closely bound with data type, so `SafeMath (uint256)` won't protect `uint32` from overflow since it will be converted to `uint256`. This means we need `SafeMath16` and `SafeMath32`.

      ```solidity
      
      but it also contains an assert statement to make sure the sum is greater than a. This protects us from overflows.
      ```

7. Comments on code

   - `//`, `///`, `/* */` can be used for commenting

   - `natspec`: Solidity community format of comment, including `@title`, `@author`, `@notice`, `@param`, `@return` and `@dev`

      ```solidity
      /// @title xx
      /// @author xxx
      /// @notice xx
      contract Math {
        /// @notice Multiplies 2 numbers together
        /// @param x the first uint.
        /// @param y the second uint.
        /// @return z the product of (x * y)
        /// @dev This function does not currently check for overflows
        function multiply(uint x, uint y) returns (uint z) {...}
      }
      ```

#### Lesson 6 of Solidity

1. ​	Web3

   - `web3.js` is a packet of nodejs

      ```sh
      $ npm install web3
      ```

   - Web3 Provider tells us which blockchain node we should be talking to.  `Infura` is a third-party provider that maintains a set of Ethereum nodes with a caching layer for fast reads, which we can access for free through their API.

      ```js
      var web3 = new Web3(new Web3.providers.WebsocketProvider("wss://mainnet.infura.io/ws"));
      ```

   - Private keys manager [Metamask](https://metamask.io/). Metamask is a browser extension for Chrome and Firefox that lets users securely manage their Ethereum accounts and private keys, and use these accounts to interact with websites that are using Web3.js. We can use Metamask's provider, if Metamask is installed (Metamask injects their web3 provider into the browser in the global JavaScript object `web3`).

      ```js
      window.addEventListener('load', function() {
        // Checking if Web3 has been injected by the browser (Mist/MetaMask)
        if (typeof web3 !== 'undefined') {
          // Use Mist/MetaMask's provider
          web3js = new Web3(web3.currentProvider);
        } else {...}
        startApp()
      })
      ```

2. Communication with Depolyed Contract

   - Web3.js use contract `address` and `ABI` to communicate with the deployed contract.

   - When we deploy the contract, we can get a fixed  `address` on Ethereum where the contract lives forever.

   - `ABI` is a JSON format application binary interface standard generated by Solidity compiler. 

      ```js
      var cryptoZombiesABI = [
        {
          "constant": false,
          "inputs": [
            {
              "name": "_approved",
              "type": "address"
            },
            {
              "name": "_tokenId",
              "type": "uint256"
            }
          ],
          "name": "approve",
          "outputs": [],
          "payable": true,
          "stateMutability": "payable",
          "type": "function"
        },...,{}
      ]
      ```

3. How does Web3.js call functions on contract

   - Web3.js has two methods to call functions on the contract: `call` and `send`.

   - `call` is used for `view` and `pure` functions (read-only, no gas, no need to sign transaction with MetaMask). It only runs on the local node, and won't create a transaction on the blockchain.

      ```js
      myContract.methods.myMethod(123).call()
      ```

   - `send` is used for any functions that aren't `view` or `pure`. `send` will create a transaction and change data on the blockchain (require gas, need MetaMask to sign a transaction).

      ```js
      myContract.methods.myMethod(123).send()
      ```

4. Metamask & Accounts

   - Getting user's account in MetaMask

      ```js
      var userAccount = web3.eth.accounts[0]
      ```

5. JQuery

   - get a div by id

      ```js
      $("#zombies")
      ```

   - Loop

      ```js
      for (id of ids) {...}
      ```

6. Call and Send

   - call and promise

      ```js
      getZombieDetails(id).then(function(zombie){});
      getZombieDetails(id).then(func);
      ```

   - send and promise

      ```js
      // "receipt" and "error" are event listeners
      // send() needs a "from" address of who's calling the function, which becomes msg.sender in Solidity code and gas as parameters. If the send() doesn't specify gas, MetaMask will let the user choose the values.
      cryptoZombies.methods.createRandomZombie(name)
          .send({ from: userAccount, gas: 3000000 })
          .on("receipt", function(receipt) {
          $("#txStatus").text("Successfully created " + name + "!");
          // Transaction was accepted into the blockchain, let's redraw the UI
          getZombiesByOwner(userAccount).then(displayZombies);
      })
          .on("error", function(error) {
          // Do something to alert the user their transaction has failed
          $("#txStatus").text(error);
      });
      ```

   - Payable functions 

      - When sending Ether along with a function, we need to specify how much to send in `wei`, not `ether`.

      - `wei` is the smallest sub-unit of Ether, 10^18 `wei` = 1 `ether`

         ```js
         // convert 1 ETH to Weis
         web3js.utils.toWei("1");
         // send() payable function
         cryptoZombies.methods.levelUp(zombieId)
         .send({ from: userAccount, value: web3js.utils.toWei("0.001", "ether") })
         ```

7. Subscribing to Events

   - How does web3.js listen for event in Solidity

      ```js
      // Solidity
      event NewZombie(uint zombieId, string name, uint dna);
      
      // js
      cryptoZombies.events.NewZombie()
      .on("data", function(event) {...})
      .on("error", console.error);
      ```

   - How to filter events? The method above will be triggered every time the event is emitted in DApp — not just for the current user. To filter events, Solidity uses keyword `indexed`, and web3.js use `filter`.

      ```js
      // Solidity
      event Transfer(address indexed _from, address indexed _to, uint256 _tokenId);
      
      // js, only fire this code when `_to` equals `userAccount`
      cryptoZombies.events.Transfer({ filter: { _to: userAccount } })
      .on("data", function(event) {...})
      .on("error", console.error);
      ```

   - Querying past events and filter them with time range. web3.js uses `getPastEvents`.

      ```js
      cryptoZombies.getPastEvents("NewZombie", { fromBlock: 0, toBlock: "latest" })
      .then(function(events) {...});
      ```

#### Lesson 1 of Truffle - Testing

1. Set Up

   - Every time you compile a smart contract, the *Solidity* compiler generates a JSON file (referred to as <u>build artifacts</u>) which contains the binary representation of that contract and saves it in the `build/contracts` folder. Then we run a migration, `Truffle` updates this file with the information related to that network.

   - Load the build artifacts of contract

      ```js
      // require("contract name")
      const CryptoZombies = artifacts.require("CryptoZombies");
      ```

   - JS calls a function named `contract()` to group tests. `contract()` takes two arguments: a `string` indicating what we’re going to test and a `callback` where we’re going to actually write our tests. In the callback, we call a function named `it()` which also takes two arguments: a `string` describing what the test actually does and a callback.

      ```js
      const CryptoZombies = artifacts.require("CryptoZombies");
      contract("CryptoZombies", (accounts) => {
          let [alice, bob] = accounts;
          it("should be able to create a new zombie", async () => {
              //...
          })
      })
      ```

2. Test with [Ganache](https://truffleframework.com/ganache)

   - Ganache is a tool for testing.  Ganache will sets up a local Ethereum network, create 10 test accounts and give them 100 Ethers. We can access the created accounts through the `accounts` array. For ease of reading and coding, we write `accounts[0]` and `accounts[1]` as:

      ```js
      // accounts[0] and accounts[1]
      let [alice, bob] = accounts;
      ```

3. Use contract abstraction (build artifacts) to initialize instances of contract

   ```js
   const contractInstance = await myAwesomeContract.new();
   ```

4. The Fist Test

   - Setup -> Act -> Assert

   - Setup. As described above

   - Act. Firstly get an instance of contract from contract abstraction, then call the function of contract to be tested (contains the parameter of function and the address of mocked sender).

     ```js
     const result = await contractInstance.createRandomZombie("zombie 1", {from: alice})
     ```

   - Assert. Use the built-in `assert.equal()` or `assert.deepEqual()` to test the compliance of contract function.

   - Refer the execution result of function call as `result`, `result`contains the following contents:

     - `result.tx`: the transaction hash.
     - `result.receipt`: an object containing the transaction receipt. 
     - `result.receipt.status`: if it is equal to `true` it means that the transaction was successful. Otherwise, it means that the transaction failed.
     - `result.logs[0].args`: the result of the tested function.

     ```js
     const CryptoZombies = artifacts.require("CryptoZombies");
     contract("CryptoZombies", (accounts) => {
         let [alice, bob] = accounts;
         it("should be able to create a new zombie", async () => {
             const contractInstance = await CryptoZombies.new();
             // act and assert
             const result = await contractInstance.createRandomZombie("Zombie 1", {from: alice});
             assert.equal(result.receipt.status, true);
             assert.equal(result.logs[0].args.name, "Zombie 1");
         })
     })
     ```

5. The hooks of Truffle (be like lifecycle)

   - Every time we call `contract.new()`, `Truffle` will deploy a new contract. It's bloated to continuously call `contract.new()` in `it()` without destroying the contract.

   - Thus, we need hooks, such as `beforeEach()`, `it()`, `afterEach()`

     ```js
     const CryptoZombies = artifacts.require("CryptoZombies");
     contract("CryptoZombies", (accounts) => {
         let [alice, bob] = accounts;
         let contractInstance;
         // before
         beforeEach(async () => {
             contractInstance = await CryptoZombies.new();
         });
         // test
         it("should be able to create a new zombie", async () => {
             const result = await contractInstance.createRandomZombie("Zombie 1", {from: alice});
             assert.equal(result.receipt.status, true);
             assert.equal(result.logs[0].args.name,"Zombie 1");
         })
         // after
         afterEach(async () => {
             await contractInstance.kill();
         });
     })
     ```

6. How to test the logic that we except the contract to throw an error

   ```js
   // utils.js
   try {
       // suppose to throw error
       await contractInstance.createRandomZombie(zombieNames[1], {from: alice});
       assert(true);
   }
   catch (err) {
       return;
   }
   assert(false, "The contract did not throw.");
   ```

7. Group Test and The `x` Mark 

   - Use `context` to group tests

     ```js
     context("with the two-step transfer scenario", async () => {
         it("first-step", async () => {...})
         it("second-step", async () => {...})
     })
     ```

   - use `x` mark to skip some tests

   ```js
   // xcontext(...)
   // xit(...)
   ```

8. Move Forward in Time

   - Use `evm_increaseTime` and `evm_mine` to Virtually move forward in time.

   - `evm_increaseTime` increases the time for the next block.

   - `evm_mine` mines a new block.

     ```js
     await web3.currentProvider.sendAsync({
       jsonrpc: "2.0",
       method: "evm_increaseTime",
       params: [86400],  // there are 86400 seconds in a day
       id: new Date().getTime()
     }, () => { });
     
     web3.currentProvider.send({
         jsonrpc: '2.0',
         method: 'evm_mine',
         params: [],
         id: new Date().getTime()
     });
     ```

9. Another Readable Assertion Module: `chai`

   ```sh
   $ npm -g install chai
   ```

   - `expect`: lets you chain natural language assertions as follows:

     ```js
     let lessonTitle = "Testing Smart Contracts with Truffle";
     expect(lessonTitle).to.be.a("string");
     expect(lessonTitle).to.equal("Testing Smart Contracts with Truffle");
     ```

   - `should`: allows for similar assertions as `expect` interface, but the chain starts with a `should` property:

     ```js
     let lessonTitle = "Testing Smart Contracts with Truffle";
     lessonTitle.should.be.a("string");
     ```

   - `assert`: provides a notation similar to that packaged with node.js and includes several additional tests and it's browser compatible:

     ```js
     let lessonTitle = "Testing Smart Contracts with Truffle";
     assert.typeOf(lessonTitle, "string");
     ```

10. Loom Testnet

    - Configure truffle for testing on loom (partially)

      ```js
      // truffle.js or truffle-config.js
      loom_testnet: {
          provider: function() {
              const privateKey = 'YOUR_PRIVATE_KEY';
              const chainId = 'extdev-plasma-us1';
              const writeUrl = 'wss://extdev-basechain-us1.dappchains.com/websocket';
              const readUrl = 'wss://extdev-basechain-us1.dappchains.com/queryws';
              const loomTruffleProvider = new LoomTruffleProvider(chainId, writeUrl, readUrl, privateKey);
              loomTruffleProvider.createExtraAccountsFromMnemonic(mnemonic, 10);
              return loomTruffleProvider;
          },
          network_id: 'extdev'
      }
      ```

#### Lesson 2 of Truffle - Deploying

1. Install the truffle with npm

   ```sh
   $ npm install truffle -g
   ```

2. Generate the directory structure

   ```sh
   $ truffle init
   ```

3. Truffle's Default Directory Structure

   - `contracts`: all the smart contracts. To keep the code organized, we can create sub-folders such as `contracts/tokens`. 

   - `migrations`: a migration is a JavaScript file that tells Truffle how to deploy a smart contract.

   - `test`: the unit tests which will be JavaScript or Solidity files.

   - `truffle.js` and `truffle-config.js`: config files used to store the network settings for deployment. Truffle needs two config files because on Windows having both `truffle.js` and `truffle.exe` in the same folder might generate conflicts. If running Windows, it is advised to delete `truffle.js` and use `truffle-config.js` as the default config file. See more on [truffle official documentation](https://truffleframework.com/docs/truffle/reference/configuration).

     ```sh
     ├── contracts
         ├── Migrations.sol
     ├── migrations
         ├── 1_initial_migration.js
     └── test
     truffle-config.js
     truffle.js
     ```

4. Install other dependency package (after the `truffle init`, because `truffle init` expects to find an empty directory), such as `truffle-hdwallet-provider` handling transaction signing.

   ```sh
   $ npm install truffle-hdwallet-provider
   ```

5. Compile the Solidity Source Code to bytecode

   - Execute the `truffle compile`. This command should create the build artifacts of `./contracts` and place them in the `./build/contracts` directory.

     ```sh
     $ truffle compile
     ```

6. Migrations

   - The default code in `1_initial_migration.js` is like:

     ```js
     var Migrations = artifacts.require("./Migrations.sol");
     module.exports = function(deployer) {
       deployer.deploy(Migrations);
     };
     ```

7. The Configuration File for `Rinkeby`

   - Contracts deployed to the main net can't be modified, thus there are some test net where ether is free, such as PoA and Rinkeby.

   - The provider of net is wrapped in a function, which ensures that it won't get initialized until it's needed.

     ```js
     var HDWalletProvider = require("truffle-hdwallet-provider");
     // Set the own mnemonic here
     const mnemonic = "YOUR_MNEMONIC";
     
     module.exports = {
       networks: {
         // Configuration for mainnet
         mainnet: {
           provider: function () {
             // Setting the provider with the Infura Mainnet address and Token
             return new HDWalletProvider(mnemonic, "https://mainnet.infura.io/v3/YOUR_TOKEN")
           },
           network_id: "1"
         },
         // Configuration for rinkeby network
         rinkeby: {
           provider: function () {
             return new HDWalletProvider(mnemonic, "https://rinkeby.infura.io/v3/YOUR_TOKEN")
           },
           network_id: 4
         }
       }
     };
     ```

   - Something about Migration

     - Migration is a JavaScript file that tells Truffle how to modify the state of the smart contracts.
     - Migrations provide a convenient way to keep track of the changes in code.
     - The first migration will just deploy the smart contract. Some other migrations deploy a new version of the code to add features or fix bugs.
     - Deploying more than one contract needs separate migration files for each contract, and migrations are always executed in order- 1,2,3, etc.

8. Deploy on `Rinkeby`

   - Gas in account is needed for deployment. For test purposes, running a service name [faucet](https://faucet.rinkeby.io/) for a few minutes can make the account have Ether.

     ```sh
     $ truffle migrate --network rinkeby
     # truffle deploy --network rinkeby   => the same as truffle migrate
     # truffle migrate --network mainnet
     # truffle migrate --network rinkeby --reset => in case of previous contract
     ```

   - Migration is a JavaScript file that tells **Truffle** how to modify the state of our smart contracts.

9. Loom as Main Net

   - Building DApps on Ethereum will require users to pay gas fees for every transaction. But this isn't ideal for a user-facing DApp or a game.

   - On Loom, users can have gas-free transactions, making things much better for games and other non-financial applications.

   - install npm package

     ```sh
     $ npm install loom-truffle-provider
     ```

   - Download and install Loom from [loom tutorial](https://loomx.io/developers/en/basic-install-all.html).

10. Deploy on Loom Test Net

    - Create our own private key

      ```sh
      $ ./loom genkey -a public_key -k private_key
      $ cat private_key
      ```

    - Change the config file `truffle.js`

      ```js
      // similar to rinkeby:{} and mainnet:{}
      const LoomTruffleProvider = require('loom-truffle-provider');
      loom_testnet: {
        provider: function() {
          const privateKey = 'YOUR_PRIVATE_KEY'
          const chainId = 'extdev-plasma-us1';
          const writeUrl = 'http://extdev-plasma-us1.dappchains.com:80/rpc';
          const readUrl = 'http://extdev-plasma-us1.dappchains.com:80/query';
          return new LoomTruffleProvider(chainId, writeUrl, readUrl, privateKey);
        },
        network_id: '9545242630824'
      }
      ```

    - Deploy

      ```sh
      $ truffle migrate --network loom_testnet
      ```

11. Deploy to Loom Basechain (Main Net)

    - Seriously treat the private key.

      - Generate it with `./loom genkey -a mainnet_public_key -k mainnet_private_key`
      - Add the file of private key to `.gitignore`
      - let node.js read private key from file with `fs`, `path` and `join`

    - Change the config file

      ```js
      const LoomTruffleProvider = require('loom-truffle-provider');
      const { readFileSync } = require('fs');
      const path = require('path');
      const { join } = require('path');
      // let node.js read private key from file
      function getLoomProviderWithPrivateKey (privateKeyPath, chainId, writeUrl, readUrl) {
        const privateKey = readFileSync(privateKeyPath, 'utf-8');
        return new LoomTruffleProvider(chainId, writeUrl, readUrl, privateKey);
      }
      // similar to rinkeby:{} and loom_testnet:{}
      basechain: {
        provider: function() {
          const chainId = 'default';
          const writeUrl = 'http://basechain.dappchains.com/rpc';
          const readUrl = 'http://basechain.dappchains.com/query';
          return new LoomTruffleProvider(chainId, writeUrl, readUrl, privateKey);
          const privateKeyPath = path.join(__dirname, 'mainnet_private_key');
          const loomTruffleProvider = getLoomProviderWithPrivateKey(privateKeyPath, chainId, writeUrl, readUrl);
          return loomTruffleProvider;
        },
        network_id: '*'
      }
      ```

    - White the deployment keys. Following the instructions from [loom tutorial](https://loomx.io/developers/en/deploy-loom-mainnet.html).

    - Deploy

      ```sh
      $ truffle migrate --network basechain
      ```
