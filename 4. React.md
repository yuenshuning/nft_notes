## React

#### Lesson 1 JSX

1. `JSX`

   - `JSX` is a syntax extension for JavaScript, which looks like HTML.

   - `JSX` is not valid JavaScript, thus it should be compiled to regular JavaScript before reaching a web browser

   - `JSX` element can be saved in a variable/object/array, and passed to a function.

   - Also, `JSX` element has attributes, like `href` and `style`

   - `JSX` elements can be nested inside of other`JSX` elements (multi-line JSX expression must be wrapped in `()`)

     ```js
     const myTeam = {
       center: <li>Benzo Walli</li>,
       powerForward: <li>Rasha Loa</li>
     };
     // multi-line JSX expression
      const theExample = (
        <a href="https://www.example.com"><h1>
            Click me!
        </h1></a>
      );
     ```

2. Rendering `JSX`

   - `ReactDOM` is a JavaScript library dealing with the DOM. `ReactDOM.render()` can be used to render `JSX`. It takes a `JSX` expression, creates a corresponding tree of DOM nodes, and adds that tree to the DOM.

     ```js
     ReactDOM.render(
         <h1>Hello world</h1>,
         document.getElementById('app')
     );
     ```

   - The first argument of  `ReactDOM.render()` is a `JSX` expression or `JSX` element stored in variables, and the second argument is a DOM element. The first argument is appended to the selected element (second argument).

     ```html
     <main id="app">
       <h1>Hello world</h1>
     </main>
     ```

3. Virtual DOM

   -  Thanks to the virtual DOM, `ReactDOM.render()` only updates DOM elements that have changed (it doesn't unneccessarily render the same DOMs twice).
   - Virtual DOM: When rendering a `JSX` element, every virtual DOM object gets updated (the cost is low because the virtual DOM updates quickly). Once the virtual DOM has updated, then React compares the virtual DOM with a virtual DOM snapshot that was taken before the update. By comparing the new virtual DOM with a pre-update version (called “diffing”), React knows which virtual DOM objects have changed, then React updates only those changed objects on the real DOM.

4. Advanced `JSX`

   - Instead of `class` attribute, `JSX` uses `className`, because `class` is a reserved word in JS

   - `self-closing` tag: `<img/>`

   - Use `{}` to inject JavaScript in `JSX` expression

     ```js
     // 1
     const ex1 = <h>2+3={2+3}</h>
     // 2
     let theString = 'this is str'
     const ex2 = <h>{theString}</h>
     // 3
     let urls = 'http://bit.ly/1Tqltv5';
     const ex3 = (
       <img src={urls} />
     );
     ```

   - Special attributes of `JSX` element: `event listener`

   - Note: we cannot inject `if` statement directly in `JSX` element, there are some ways of writing conditionals

     - Use a variable to express information
     - Use `ternary operator -> x ? y : z`
     - Use the `&&` operator. If the expression on the left of the `&&` evaluates as <u>true</u>, then the JSX on the right of the `&&` will be rendered (if the left side expression is <u>false</u>, do nothing).

     ```js
     // wrong
     const wrong_ex = (
       <h1>{
           if (purchase.complete) {
               'Thank you for placing an order!'
           }
       }</h1>
     )
     // method 1
     let message;
     if (..) {
       message = <div>..</div>
     } else {
       message = <div>..</div>
     }
     ReactDOM.render(message, document.getElementById('app'));
     // method 2
     const ex2 = <h1>{x?y:z}</h1>
     // method 3
     const ex3 = (
         {age > 15 && <h1>aa</h1>}
         {age > 20 && <h1>bb</h1>}
     )
     ```

   - `.map()` is an array method used to gain a new list

     ```js
     const strings = ['Home', 'Shop', 'About Me'];
     const listItems = strings.map((string,index) => <li>{string}</li>);
     ```

   - The attribute `key` of `JSX` element. When there is a list-items, we'd better add an unique `key` to each element

   - The `JSX` expression is equal to `React.createElement()`

     ```js
     const h1 = <h1>Hello world</h1>;
     const h1 = React.createElement("h1",null,"Hello, world");
     ```

#### Lesson 2 React Component

1. Use a JavaScript class to define a new React component (React component can also be defined by function):

   - extend the `React.Component` class to make a component class

   - The only one property included (rewritten) in the component class is a `render()` method, which returns a `JSX` element. 

   - Use a HTML-like tag to refer to an instance of component class.

     ```js
     class MyComponentClass extends React.Component {
       render() {
         return (
             <div>
                 <h1>Hello world</h1>
             </div>
         );
       }
     };
     ReactDOM.render(<MyComponentClass />, document.getElementById('app'));
     ```

   - What happens when we pass `<MyComponentClass />` as the first argument of `ReactDOM.render()`? `ReactDOM.render()` will tell `<MyComponentClass />` to call its `render()` method, which will return the `JSX` element `<h1>Hello world</h1>`. `ReactDOM.render()` will then add it to the virtual DOM.

2. Inject JavaScript into `JSX` inside of a `render()` function of component class.

   - A mistake syntax

     ```js
     // wrong, because the `n` declaration should be in the render function
     class Random extends React.Component {
       const n = Math.floor(Math.random() * 10 + 1);
       render() {
         return <h1>The number is {n}!</h1>;
       }
     };
     ```

   - The syntax mistake above is due to the scope of the `n`. When `ReactDOM.render()` tells `<Random/>` to call its `render()`, the `n` is not in the scope of `render()`. We can use `this.n` to refer to `n`, or include the `n` declaration inside `render()` function

     ```js
     class Random extends React.Component {
       const n = Math.floor(Math.random() * 10 + 1);
       render() {
         return <h1>The number is {this.n}!</h1>;
       }
     };
     
     class Random extends React.Component { 
       render() {
         const n = Math.floor(Math.random() * 10 + 1);
         return <h1>The number is {n}!</h1>;
       }
     };
     ```

#### Lesson 3 Components Interaction

1. Components Render Other Components

   - `.render()` method of component class can return an HTML-like JSX element, it can also return an instance of another component class

     ```js
     class OMG extends React.Component {
       render() {...}
     }
     class Crazy extends React.Component {
       render() {
         return (
             <div>
                 <h1>title</h1>
                 <OMG />
             </div>
         );
       }
     }
     ```

   - Import

     - Import library

       ```js
       import ReactDOM from 'react-dom';
       ```

     - Import a variable declared in another file. If the string at the end of `import` begins with either a dot (`.`) or a slash (`/`), then `import` will treat the string as a filepath. `import` will follow that filepath and import the file that it finds. If the filepath doesn’t have a file extension, then “.js” is assumed.

       ```js
       import { NavBar } from './NavBar.js';
       // or
       import { NavBar } from './NavBar';
       ```

   - Export (Named Exports)

     - Place the keyword `export` immediately before something that you want to export. That something can be any top-level `var`, `let`, `const`, `function`, or `class`:

       ```js
       export const myStr = '...';
       export class NavBar extends React.Component {...};
       ```

2. Component’s `props` Object

   - A component’s `props` is an object. It holds information about that component.

   - Passing information to a component is like passing an attribute to HTML-tag. And, the passed information is stored in component’s `this.props` object

     ```js
     class MyComponentClass extends React.Component {
       render() {
         return <h1>{this.props.myProp}!</h1>;
       }
     }
     <MyComponentClass myProp="Hello"/>
     ```

   - Passing information from component to component

     ```js
     class AnotherComponent extends React.Component {
       render() {
         const myName = "aa";
         return (
           <div>
             <MyComponentClass myProp="xxx"/>
             <MyComponentClass myProp={myName}/>
           </div>
         );
       }
     }
     ```

   - Passing an Event Handler as a prop. Since `<Button/>` is a component rather than an HTML-like `JSX` element, the `onClick` is only a prop name rather an event listener.

     ```js
     // Talker.js
     class Talker extends React.Component {
       handleClick() {
         alert("blah blah blah");
       }
       
       render() {
         return <Button onClick={this.handleClick}/>;
       }
     }
     // Button.js
     export class Button extends React.Component {
       render() {
         return (
           <button onClick={this.props.onClick}>
             Click me!
           </button>
         );
       }
     }
     ```

   - `this.props.children` will return everything in between a component’s opening and closing JSX tags. If there are nested HTML-like tags inside self-defined, the inside tags won't be displayed, unless the component use `this.props.children` to display them.

     ```js
     // only displays <h1>Living Musicians</h1>
     class App extends React.Component {
       render() {
         return (
           <div>
             <MyComponentClass>
               <li>Sachiko M</li>
               <li>Harvey Sid Fisher</li>
             </MyComponentClass>
           </div>
         );
       }
     }
     class List extends React.Component {
       render() {
         return (
           <div>
             <h1>Living Musicians</h1>
             <ul></ul>
           </div>
         );
       }
     }
     /* displays
         <h1>Living Musicians</h1>
         <ul>
             <li>Sachiko M</li>
             <li>Harvey Sid Fisher</li>
         </ul> 
     */
     class List extends React.Component {
       render() {
         return (
           <div>
             <h1>Living Musicians</h1>
             <ul>{this.props.children}</ul>
           </div>
         );
       }
     }
     ```

   - Setting default property values by the `defaultProps` property

     ```js
     class Example extends React.Component {
       render() {
         return <h1>{this.props.text}</h1>;
       }
     }
      
     Example.defaultProps = { text: 'yo' }; 
     ```

3. Component’s `state` Object (Dynamic)

   - A component’s `state` is an object, just like `props`. But the `state` can be dynamically changed. The declaration of `state` is inside the `constructor()` method

     ```js
     class App extends React.Component {
       constructor(props) {
         super(props);
         this.state = { title: 'Best App' };
       }
     	
       render() {
         return <h1>{this.state.title}</h1>
       }
     }
     ```

   - A component changes its state by calling the function `this.setState()`. <u>Note</u>: we cannot call `this.setState()` from inside of the `render()` function, so we should wrap  `this.setState()` in a new function.

     ```js
     this.setState({ title: 'Better App' });
     ```

   - Every time we call `this.setState()`, `this.setState()` <u>automatically</u> calls `.render()` as soon as the state has changed. That is why you cannot call `this.setState()` from inside of the `render()` method.

   - If we are going to uses `this` inside an event handler, we need to bind `this` to the event handler by adding `this.handlerName= this.handlerName.bind(this)` to the constructor. Because, `this.handlerName()` loses its `this` when it is called

     ```js
     class Example extends React.Component {
       constructor(props) {
         super(props);
         this.state = { weather: 'sunny' };
         this.makeSomeFog = this.makeSomeFog.bind(this);
       }
       makeSomeFog() {
         this.setState({
           weather: 'foggy'
         });
       }
       render() {
         return (
           <div>
             <h1>It's {this.state.weather}!</h1>
             <button onClick={this.makeSomeFog}>Click Me</button>
           </div>
         );
       }
     }
     ```

#### Lesson 4 Component Lifecycle

1. React components have several methods, called lifecycle methods, such as `constructor()` and `render()`. `constructor()` is the first method called during the mounting phase, and `render()` is called during both the mounting and updating phase.

2. The component lifecycle has three high-level parts:

   - Mounting: when the component is being initialized and put into the DOM for the first time.  During the Mounting Phase, four methods are called:

     - `constructor(props)`
     - `getDerivedStateFromProps()`
     - `render()`
     - `componentDidMount()`

   - Updating: when the component updates as a result of changed state or changed props. Two methods are called during updating phase, such as `render()` and `componentDidUpdate()`. Note: methods of mounting phase are called only once, but the methods of updating phase are called every time `state` or  `props` are changed

     ```js
     // argument: prevProps, the props of component the last time it was rendered
     componentDidUpdate(prevProps) {...}
     ```

   - Unmounting: when the component is being removed from the DOM. We should stop some code from running unnecessarily. Such as calling `clearInterval()` in `componentWillUnmount()` during the unmounting phase.

#### Lesson 5 Hooks

1. Functional Component (opp Class Component)

   - Functional components are React components defined as JavaScript functions. And functional components must return `JSX`

   - Converting class component to functional component. 

     ```js
     // class component
     export class MyComponentClass extends React.Component {
       render() {
         return <h1>Hello world</h1>;
       }
     }
     
     // functional component:
     export const MyComponentClass = () => {
       return <h1>Hello world</h1>;
     }
     ```

   - Functional components receive `props` via function parameter

     ```js
     export const MyComponentClass = (props) => {
       return (
           <div>
               <h1>{props.title}</h1>
           </div>
       );
     }
     ReactDOM.render(<MyComponentClass title="Hi"/>, document.getElementById('app'));
     ```

2. Hooks

   - Hooks help developers manage the internal state of components and handle post-rendering side effects directly from <u>functional components</u>, instead of dealing with these things inside class components in the past. Hooks don’t work inside classes. [built-in Hooks](https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-reference.html)

   - built-in hook `useState()`

     - `useState()` is a predefined JavaScript function in the React library. It returns an array with two values

       - current state - the current value of this state;
       - state setter - a function that we can use to update the value of this state. Calling the state setter signals to React that the component needs to re-render.

     - To initialize the state, we simply pass the initial value as an argument to the `useState()` function call. If we don’t pass an initial value, then the current state during the first render will be `undefined`.

       ```js
       import React, { useState } from 'react';
        
       export default function EmailTextInput() {
         const [email, setEmail] = useState('');
         const handleChange = (event) => {
           const updatedEmail = event.target.value;
           setEmail(updatedEmail);
         }
        
         return (
           <input value={email} onChange={handleChange} />
         );
       }
       ```

     - Pass a callback function as the argument for `setCount()` instead of a value to use the previous value of state

       ```js
       const [count, setCount] = useState(0);
       setCount(prevCount => prevCount + 1);
       ```

     - array spread syntax

       ```js
       // add `item` element to `prev` array
       setProfile(prev => [item, ...prev])
       setProfile((prev) => ({["key"]: value, ...prev}))
       ```

     - Multiple hooks and separate state variables

       ```js
       const [title, setTitle] = useState("Best Musical Ever");
       const [actors, setActors] = useState(["George Wilson", "Tim Hughes"]);
       ```

   - built-in hook `useEffect()`

     - `useEffect()` is a predefined JavaScript function in the React library. It is used to execute some code after each render. It takes two values as arguments: 

       - effect - callback function that we want React to call after each time this component renders;
       - dependency array - tell the `useEffect()` method when to call our effect and when to skip it. Our effect is always called after the first render but only called again if something in our dependency array has changed values between renders. There are three kinds of dependency array configuration:
         - Not specified: to call an effect every re-render
         - Empty dependency array: to call an effect only when the component first mounts.
         - Non-empty array: can skip calling the effect after re-renders unless the value of one of the variables in our dependency array has changed.

     - <u>Clean Up Effects</u>: Remove some objects when we are done with the effect

       ```js
       // return a cleanup function
       useEffect(()=>{
         document.addEventListener('keydown', handleKeyPress);
         return () => {
           document.removeEventListener('keydown', handleKeyPress);
         };
       })
       ```

     - Two Main Rules

       - only call Hooks at the top level - never call hooks inside of loops, conditions, or nested functions.
       - only call Hooks from React functions - cannot use Hooks in class components

     - Multiple effects and separate hooks

       ```js
       // effect 1
       const [menu, setMenu] = useState(null);
       useEffect(() => {
         get('/menu').then((response) => setMenu(response.data));
       }, []);
       // effect 2
       const [friends, setFriends] = useState(null);
       useEffect(() => {
         get('/friends').then((response) => setFriends(response.data));
       }, []);
       ```

#### Lesson 6 Stateless Components From Stateful Components

1. Stateless vs. Stateful
   - Stateless class components do not have `state`
   - Stateless class components use `this.props` to receive information from stateful components
   - A component should never update `this.props` through something like `this.setState()`
   - A React component should use `props` to store information that can be changed, but can <u>only be changed by a different component</u>.
   - A React component should use `state` to store information that the component <u>itself can change</u>.
2. Child Components Update Their Parents' state
   1. The parent component defines a method
   2. The parent component binds the newly-defined method to the instance of parent component `this`
   3. Then parent component passes the method down to child component. The child component calls the passed-down function and update the parent’s state.
   4. Note: event listener passes an event object as an argument, need to be extracted
3. Child Components Update Sibling Components
   1. Peer components communicate through the `state` of parent component. For example, one child component change parent's `state` by parent's `handler function`, another sibling child component displays the `state`

#### Lesson 7 Advanced React Topic

1. CSS Style

   1. Inline css style with double curly braces looks funny

      ```js
      <h1 style={{ color: 'red' }}>Hello world</h1>
      ```

   2. Defining a style object variable (style names are in camelCase) and passing it to `style` to avoid the double curly braces

      ```js
      const styles = {
        marginTop: '20px',
        backgroundColor: 'green'
      };
      <h1 style={styles}>Hello world</h1>
      ```

   3. Storing reusable styles in a separate JavaScript file

      ```js
      const fontFamily = 'Comic Sans MS, Lucida Handwriting, cursive';
      const fontSize = '4em';
      const padding = '45px 0';
      
      export const styles = {
        fontFamily: fontFamily,
        fontSize: fontSize,
        padding: padding
      };
      ```

2. Separating container components from presentational components

   1. It's a React programming pattern
   2. If a component has to <u>have state, make calculations based on props, or manage any other complex logic (calculations/logic)</u>, then that component shouldn’t also have to <u>render HTML-like `JSX` (presentation/rendering)</u>.
   3. Removed all of the `calculation/logic` code from the `presentational component`. The presentational component’s only job is to contain HTML-like JSX. It should be an exported component and will not render itself because a presentational component will always get rendered by a container component.
   4. Removed all of the `presentation/rendering` code from the `container component`. The container component should do the functional part (state, calculations, etc.), render only the presentational component (only return an instance of presentational component) <u>instead of</u> rendering `JSX`.
   5. Refer to [example](https://www.codecademy.com/courses/react-101/lessons/container-presentational-components/exercises/container-presentational-components-review)

3. `propTypes`

   - Why `propTypes`?

     - Documentation - makes it easier to glance at a file and quickly understand the component

     - Prop validation - declare `propTypes` as a property for the component after the component has been defined, the `propTypes` will indicate the expected `propType` of the component

       - The `propType` is like `PropTypes.string`, `PropTypes.object`, `PropTypes.bool`, `PropTypes.number`, `PropTypes.func` and `PropTypes.array`

       - If we add `.isRequired` to a `propType`, then the console will warn if that `prop` isn’t sent.

         ```js
         import React from 'react';
         import PropTypes from 'prop-types';
         
         export class myComponent extends React.Component {
           render() {
             return <h1 style={this.props.style}>{this.props.message}</h1>;
           }
         }
         myComponent.propTypes = {
           message: PropTypes.string,
           style: PropTypes.object.isRequired
         };
         ```

   - How to write `propTypes` for a function component? similar

     ```js
     const Example = (props) => {
       return <h1>{props.message}</h1>;
     }
      
     Example.propTypes = {
       message: PropTypes.string.isRequired
     };
     ```

4. React Forms

   - When dealing with `<input />`, how to make the `<input />`‘s text responsive to the input value? Use `onChange` and `value`

     ```js
     handleUserInput(e) {
         this.setState({userInput: e.target.value})
     }
     // ...
     <input type="text" onChange={this.handleUserInput} value={this.state.userInput}/>
     ```

   - Controlled vs Uncontrolled

     - There are two terms about React forms: controlled component and uncontrolled component. 

     - An uncontrolled component is a component that maintains its own internal state. A controlled component is a component that does not maintain any internal state (must be controlled by someone else through `props`).

     - Think of a typical `<input type='text' />`element. It keeps track of its own text and is an uncontrolled component. It maintains its own internal state, by remembering data about itself:

       ```js
       let input = document.querySelector('input[type="text"]');
       let typedText = input.value;
       ```

     - However, when we give `<input />` a `value` attribute, then the `<input />` becomes controlled. It stops using its internal storage and relies on the `this.props.value` passed by other components
