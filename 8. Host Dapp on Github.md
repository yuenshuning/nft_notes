   1. [Vercel](https://vercel.com/)
   2. Deploy
      1. Import repos from github, view the configuration and click the 'deploy' button

   3. Domain name
      1. Dashboard -> Click the website -> Settings -> Domains
      2. Paste our own domain name and add domain
      3. Go to the domain name DNS Provider (for example [namecheap](https://www.namecheap.com/domains/domain-name-search/)), and add a new record (A type) according to the record shown on vercel
      4. Go back to vercel and click `refresh`
      5. Go to the domain name DNS Provider (for example [namecheap](https://www.namecheap.com/domains/domain-name-search/)), and add a new record (CNAME type) according to the record shown on vercel

2. Method Two

   1. `npm install gh-pages`

   2. create a branch of github repo named `gh-pages` 

   3. add a key-value to `package.json`, such as `homepage: https://yuenshuning.github.io/hashlips_nft_minting_dapp`

   4. add two scripts to `package.json`

      ```json
      "scripts": {
          //...
          "predeploy": "npm run build",
          "deploy": "gh-pages -d build"
      }
      ```

   5. Then we can go to the `homepage` to visit our website
