## 7. Polygon/Matic

1. Market: [Venly (previously Arkane Market)](https://venly.market/inventory) or OpenSea
2. Set up Polygon RPC for MetaMask, see [docs](https://docs.matic.today/docs/develop/metamask/config-polygon-on-metamask/)
   1. RPC URL: `https://rpc-mainnet.maticvigil.com/` 
   2. Chain ID: `137`
   3. Currency Symbol: `MATIC`
   4. Block Explorer URL field: `https://polygonscan.com/`
3. How to buy MATIC on the Polygon network
   1. Buy MATIC tokens on [transak](https://transak.com/) or [ramp](https://ramp.network/). Paste one of our account addresses to this website and pay.
   2. we can see MATIC tokens on etherum or polygon. By adding (importing) MATIC tokens to etherum mainnet on MetaMask, we can see MATIC on etherum. But now, we only focus on MATIC tokens on Polygon
   3. Also, we can transfer `ETH` from `Ethereum Mainnet` to `Polygon` through [Polygon Wallet Bridge](https://wallet.polygon.technology/bridge)  (it costs gas fee), then swap `ETH` to `MATIC` through [QuickSwap](http://quickswap.exchange/#/swap) or [Polygon Wallet Token Swap](https://wallet.polygon.technology/token-swap) (it also costs gas fee)
4. Polygon and Ethereum are two different network, but Polygon provides hydrid Proof-of-Stake , and there are staking management contracts deployed on Ethereum. So these two networks can transit state.
5. How to create a token on Polygon
   1. Mint tokens without coding through [DxSale](https://dxsale.app/app/v3/dxmint?chain=Matic)
   2. Liquidity the new tokens through [QuickSwap](http://quickswap.exchange/#/pool). Paste the token contract address and create a pair
6. Polygon TestNet: [Mumbai](https://mumbai.polygonscan.com/)
   1. Set up Mumbai RPC for MetaMask
      1. Network Name: Mumbai Testnet
      2. New RPC URL: `https://rpc-mumbai.maticvigil.com/`
      3. Chain ID: `80001`
      4. Currency Symbol: `MATIC`
      5. Block Explorer URL: `https://polygonscan.com/`
