## Node.js

#### Lesson 1 Introduction

1. Static Content / Dynamic Content

2. Storing Data

   - Relational databases (MySQL, PostgreSQL) store information in tables with columns and rows
   - Non-relational databases (NoSQL databases, like MongoDB, Redis) use other systems such as key-value pairs or a document storage model.

3. Application Program Interface (API). A collection of predefined rules for interacting with data

4. Authorization and Authentication

   - Authentication: validating the identity of a user (Who is this user? Are they who they claim to be?)
   - Authorization: controlling which users have access to which resources and actions (Who is allowed to do and see what?)

5. Stack

   - The collection of technologies used to create the front-end and back-end of a web application
   - MEAN stack: MongoDB, Express.js, AngularJS, and Node.js
   - LAMP Stack: Linux, Apache, MySQL, and PHP

6. Javascript

   - Arrow Expression
   - Promise, async, await
   - setInterval(), setTimeout(). clearInterval() and clearTimeout() can be used to exit setInterval(), setTimeout(), and the function that setInterval() and setTimeout() call.

7. JSON

   - JSON property names must be in double-quoted (" ") text even though JavaScript names do not hold by this stringency
   - A JSON data type must be one of the: string, number, object (name-value pair), array, boolean (true or false), null. Types that are not represented in JSON such as dates can be stored as a string.

8. Node.js

   - Node.js is an off-browser JavaScript environments. "Node.js is a JavaScript runtime, or an environment that allows us to execute JavaScript code outside of the browser. A 'runtime' compiles high level code down to code the computer can execute."
   - Node.js can also be used for creating command-line applications or desktop applications
   - REPL (read–eval–print loop), also termed an interactive top-level or language shell, is a simple interactive computer programming environment that takes single user inputs, executes them, and returns the result to the user.
   - Module and require()
      - Core modules are defined within Node.js’s source code and are located in the `lib` folder. Such as `util`, `console`, `process` and `os`
      - Global `console.log()`, `console.assert(boolean expression)`, `console.table()`
      - Global `process.env` stores information about the environment. Developer can also add properties to it to store information. `process.memoryUsage()` returns information on the CPU demands of the current process. `process.argv` is an array of command line values when execute the current process (absolute path to Node, the path to node.js file, other command line arguments). 
      - Non-global `os` needs to be included into the file with `require()`. `os.type()`, `os.homedir()`, `os.uptime()` and etc. will return information about the hardware, OS, and network.
      - Non-global `util` contains many predefined methods and objects. Such as `util.type.isDate()` checking data type and `util.promisify()` converting callback function into promise.

9. Node Package Manager

   - There are many third-party modules created by another developer, which solve common problems and simplify the development process. These modules are referred to as `dependencies`. 
   - These dependencies are handled by `package manager`, such as `npm`
   - [npm package collection/npm website](https://www.npmjs.com/)

10. Implementation of Module

    - JavaScript file running in a Node environment is treated as a distinct module. The functions and data defined within each module can be used by any other module, as long as those resources are properly exported and imported.

    - Note: The words “module” and “file” are often used interchangably

    - Using `module.exports` object (or ES6 `export` syntax) to export code from a file as a module that can be used by other files/modules.

       ```js
       /* individual file for module converters.js */
       // export method 1
       function celsiusToFahrenheit(celsius) {
         return celsius * (9/5) + 32;
       }
       module.exports.celsiusToFahrenheit = celsiusToFahrenheit;
       
       // export method 2
       module.exports.fahrenheitToCelsius = function(fahrenheit) {
         return (fahrenheit - 32) * (5/9);
       };
       ```

    - Using `require()` function (or ES6 `import` syntax) to import all the functions/data from another module.

       ```js
       // require('./converters.js') return the entire 'module.exports' object
       // 'module.exports' object has celsiusToFahrenheit() and celsiusToFahrenheit()
       const converters = require('./converters.js');
       const freezingPointF = converters.celsiusToFahrenheit(0);
       const boilingPointF = converters.fahrenheitToCelsius(100);
       ```

    - Using `require()` function and "object destructuring" to partly import only the needed functions.

       ```js
       // require('./converters.js') return the entire 'module.exports' object
       // the {...} extracts only celsiusToFahrenheit from 'module.exports'
       const { celsiusToFahrenheit } = require('./converters.js');
       const fahrenheitValue = celsiusToFahrenheit(0);
       ```

#### Lesson 2 Node.js Essentials

1. Events Emitter 

   - We can make our own instances of the `EventEmitter` class and emit events with the `.emit()` method. Also we can subscribe to listen for named events with the `.on()` method.

   - `.on()` of event emitter will assign a listener callback function for a event

      ```js
      let myEmitter = new events.EventEmitter();
      let newUserListener = (data) => {
        console.log(`We have a new user: ${data}.`);
      };
      // Assign the function as the listener callback for 'new user' events
      myEmitter.on('new user', newUserListener)
      ```

   - `.emit()` of event emitter will emit the event, and pass parameter to callback function

      ```js
      // Emit a 'new user' event -> newUserListener('Lily Pad')
      myEmitter.emit('new user', 'Lily Pad');
      ```

2. Input/Output

   - `console.log()` is a "wrapper" on `process.stdout.write()`, where `stdout` stands for standard output

   - `process.stdin.on()` can be used to receive input from terminal (Always Listen until program exits), where `process.stdin` is an instance of `EventEmitter`. When a user enters text into the terminal and hits enter, a `'data'` event will be fired and the anonymous listener callback will be invoked. The parameter listener receives is an instance of `Node Buffer` class, so should be converted to a string.

      ```js
      process.stdin.on('data', (userInput) => {
        let input = userInput.toString();
        console.log(input);
      });
      ```

3. Error Module

   - We can use the `error` module to generate and throw errors, such as `EvalError`, `SyntaxError`, `RangeError`, `ReferenceError`, `TypeError`, `URIError` as well as customized `Error`

   - We can use `try...catch` to handle the error

   - Many asynchronous Node APIs use `error-first` callback functions, where callback functions take an error as the first expected argument and the data as the second argument.

   - Traditional `try...catch` statements won’t work for errors thrown during asynchronous operations. We should use `error-first` callback functions.

      ```js
      // incorrect
      let callbackFunc = (data) => {
         console.log(`Something went right. Data: ${data}\n`);
      };
      try {
        api.asyncApi('problematic input', callbackFunc);
      } catch(err) {
        console.log(`Something went wrong. ${err}\n`);
      }
      
      //correct
      let callbackFunc = (err, data) => {
        if (err) {
          console.log(`Something went wrong. ${err}\n`);
        } else {
          console.log(`Something went right. Data: ${data}\n`);
        }
      };
      api.asyncApi('problematic input', callbackFunc);
      ```

4. Buffer Module

   - `Buffer` module is used to handle binary data. A `Buffer` object represents a fixed amount of memory that <u>can’t be resized</u>. `Buffer` objects are similar to an array.

   - The `.alloc()` method creates a new `Buffer` object with the specified size. It accepts three arguments: 1) Size: Required. The size of the buffer; 2) Fill: Optional. A value to fill the buffer with. Default is 0; 3) Encoding: Optional. Default is UTF-8.

      ```js
      const buffer = Buffer.alloc(5);
      console.log(buffer); // Ouput: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
      ```

   - The `.toString()` method translates the `Buffer` object into a human-readable string. It accepts three optional arguments: 1) Encoding: Default is UTF-8; 2) Start: The byte offset to begin translating in the Buffer object. Default is 0. 3) End: Default is the length of the buffer. 

      ```js
      const buffer = Buffer.alloc(5, 'a');
      console.log(buffer.toString()); // Output: aaaaa
      ```

   - The `.from()` method creates a new `Buffer` object from the specified string, array, or buffer. It accepts two arguments: 1) Object: Required. An object to fill the buffer with; 2) Encoding: Optional. Default is UTF-8.

      ```js
      const buffer = Buffer.from('hello');
      console.log(buffer); // Output: [104, 101, 108, 108, 111] UTF-8 code
      ```

   - The `.concat()` method joins all buffer objects passed in an array into one `Buffer` object, because a `Buffer` object can’t be resized. It accepts two arguments: 1) <u>Array</u>: Required. An array containing Buffer objects. 2) Length: Optional. Specifies the length of the concatenated buffer.

      ```js
      const buffer1 = Buffer.from('hello'); // Output: [104, 101, 108, 108, 111]
      const buffer2 = Buffer.from('world'); // Output:[119, 111, 114, 108, 100]
      const array = [buffer1, buffer2];
      const bufferConcat = Buffer.concat(array);
      ```

5. FS Module (File System)

   - `fs` is an API for interacting with the filesystem, because less restricted interaction with the filesystem is essential.
   - Each method available through the `fs` module has a synchronous version and an asynchronous version. For example, `fs.readFile()` take three parameters: 1) A path to the file; 2) A string specifying the file’s character encoding; 3) callback function to be invoked when the asynchronous task of reading from the file system is complete.

6. Readable Stream

   - Streaming data is the data which is read and processed sequentially, piece by piece.

   - Taking reading files line-by-line with `readline.createInterface() ` and `fs.createReadStream()` as an example.

      - `createInterface()` returns an `EventEmitter` set up to emit `'line'` events:

      - The `input` of `createInterface()` can be a data stream `fs.createReadStream()`

      - Assign a listener callback function for `'line'` event, and handle with the just read fileLine

         ```js
         const readline = require('readline');
         const fs = require('fs');
          
         const myInterface = readline.createInterface({
           input: fs.createReadStream('text.txt')
         });
          
         myInterface.on('line', (fileLine) => {
           console.log(`The line read: ${fileLine}`);
         });
         ```

7. Writable Stream

   - `fs.createWriteStream()` can create a writable stream to a file.

   - `write()` and `end()` are used to write data to file and indicate the end of a writable stream.

      ```js
      const fs = require('fs')
       
      const fileStream = fs.createWriteStream('output.txt');
       
      fileStream.write('This is the first line!'); 
      fileStream.write('This is the second line!');
      fileStream.end();
      ```

8. Timer Module

   - `setImmediate()` vs `setTimeout()`

   - `setImmediate()` vs `setTimeout()`.

      - `setImmediate()` is designed to execute a script once the current poll phase completes. `setTimeout()` schedules a script to be run after a minimum threshold in ms.

      - If we run `setImmediate()` vs `setTimeout(0)` not within an I/O cycle (i.e. the main module), the order in which the two timers are executed is non-deterministic. However, if we move the two calls within an I/O cycle, the `setImmediate` callback is always executed first

         ```js
         // non-deterministic
         setTimeout(() => {
           console.log('timeout');
         }, 0);
         setImmediate(() => {
           console.log('immediate');
         });
         
         // setImmediate callback is always executed first
         fs.readFile(__filename, () => {
           setTimeout(() => {
             console.log('timeout');
           }, 0);
           setImmediate(() => {
             console.log('immediate');
           });
         });
         ```

#### Lesson 3 HTTP

1. HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol)

   - HTTP is a request-response protocol that serves as the foundation of data exchange and communication within the client-server computing model
   - Three steps of HTTP: 1) The client submits an HTTP request message to the server; 2) The server receives the HTTP request, performs some functions on behalf of the client according to the request; 3) The server returns a response message to the client containing some information about the processing of client request.

2. Structure of HTTP

   - Structure of Request
      - Method: `GET`, `POST`, `OPTIONS`, `HEAD`
      - Path: the path of the resource relative to the root URL. Such as `/api/lessons`
      - Protocol Version: the version of the HTTP protocol (I.e. HTTP/1.1, HTTP/2, and HTTP/3)
      - Headers: convey additional information that may be important in processing a request by a server. Such as Content-Type, and more [standard headers](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers)
      - Body: data sent to the server to process a request, often attached to `POST` and `PUT` request
   - Structure of Response
      - Protocol Version: the version of the HTTP protocol, similar to the request.
      - Status Code: indicates if the request was successful (200) or error code.
      - Status Message: short description of the corresponding status code.
      - Headers: similar to the request.
      - Body: data corresponding to the fetched resource.

3. History of HTTP

   - Transport protocol
      - TCP (Transmission Control Protocol): reliable
      - UDP (User Datagram Protocol): unreliable
      - TSL (Transport Layer Security): similar as SSL. TLS with HTTP will lead to HTTPS
   - Application protocol
      - HTTP/1.1: It sends messages in the form of text. HTTP/1.1 is commonly used over TCP and is the slowest
      - HTTP/2: it encapsulates all messages in binary format rather than plain text. HTTP/2 also leverages TCP for transport.
      - HTTP/3: it use a transport protocol called QUIC, which applies specific controls over UDP.

4. `http` Module of Node.js

   - `http` core module is used to create HTTP servers and process HTTP requests

   - `http.createServer()` creates an HTTP server. `createServer()`takes a single argument in the form of a callback function. This callback function has two primary arguments; the request (req) and the response (res).

   - The `req` object contains all the information about an HTTP request, such as the HTTP method (`GET`, `POST`), pathname, headers, body, and so on. The `res` object contains methods and properties for the generation of an HTTP response, such as `.setHeader()` (sets HTTP headers on the response), `.statusCode` (set the status code of the response), and `.end()` (dispatches the response to the client)

   - `listen`() of HTTP server instance tells the server to listen for connections at the given port and carry out a task after the server has successfully started.

      ```js
      const server = http.createServer((req, res) => {
        // send 'Server is running!' to client
        res.end('Server is running!');
      });
       
      server.listen(8080, () => {
        const { address, port } = server.address();
        console.log(`Server is listening on: http://${address}:${port}`);
      })
      ```

5. The Anatomy of URL

   - A URL https://codecademy.com/articles?search=node is made up of four parts: protocol, domain, path, query (optional)

   - Protocol (https://) denotes what protocol is used

   - Domain (codecademy.com) is a unique reference identifying a website on the Internet

   - Path (/articles) refers to a file or directory or API on the web server.

   - Query (?search=node) is prefixed by `?` and used in `GET` requests to pass parameters. Such as `/articles?page=1&search=node`

   - `url` module of node.js

      ```js
      const url = require('url');
      
      const myUrl = new URL('https://www.example.com/path?query=string');
      const hostname = myUrl.hostname;
      const pathname = myUrl.pathname;
      const searchParams = myUrl.searchParams;
      
      myUrl.pathname = '/p/a/t/h';
      myUrl.search = '?prop1=value1&prop2=value2';
      myUrl.toString();
      // https://www.example.com/p/a/t/h?prop1=value1&prop2=value2
      ```

   - `querystring` module of node.js can be used to parse and stringify `query` of URL

      ```js
      // Returns { prop1: value1, prop2: value2}
      const str = 'prop1=value1&prop2=value2';
      querystring.parse(str);
      // Returns 'prop1=value1&prop2=value2'
      const props = { "prop1": value1, "prop2": value2};
      querystring.stringify(props); 
      ```

6. Routing

   - Routing is the process that server handles requests based on specific criteria such as `method`, `pathname`, etc.

   - Routing requests according to `method`

      ```js
      const server = http.createServer((req, res) => {
        const { method } = req;
        switch(method) {
          case 'GET':
            return handleGetRequest(req, res);
          case 'POST':
            return handlePostRequest(req, res);
          default:
            throw new Error(`Unsupported request method: ${method}`);
        }
      })
      ```

   - Routing requests according to `pathname`

      ```js
      function handleGetRequest(req, res) {
        const pathname = req.url;
        if (pathname === '/projects') {
          data = await getProjects();
          res.setHeader('Content-Type', 'application/json');
          return res.end(JSON.stringify(data));
        }else {
          res.statusCode = 404;
          return res.end('Requested resource does not exist');      
        }
      }
      ```

7. HTTP Status Codes

   - Response status codes are grouped into five classes

   - `Informational`: Range from 100 to 199.

   - `Successful`: Range from 200 to 299.

   - `Redirects`: Range from 300 to 399.

   - `Client Errors`: Range from 400 to 499.

   - `Server Errors`: Range from 500 to 599.

      ```js
      const handleGetRequest = (req, res) => {
        res.statusCode = 200;
        return res.end(JSON.stringify({ data: [] }));
      }
      ```

8. Interaction with Database or API

   - Web server often does not represent the final destination in processing a request from a client.

   - Node.js can interact with database or another backend API. Taking interaction with external API using `http.request()` as example:

      ```js
      const options = {
        hostname: 'example.com',
        port: 8080,
        path: '/projects',
        method: 'GET',
        headers: {
          'Content-Type': 'application/json'
        }
      }
      const request = http.request(options, res => {
        res.on('data', (d)={
          data = d;
        })
      })
      
      request.end();  //important!! send the request
      ```

9. REST Architecture

   - REST, or REpresentational State Transfer, is an architectural style for separation of Client and Server.
   - Separation: as long as client or server knows what format of messages to send to the other, they can be kept modular and separate.
   - Statelessness: systems that follow the REST Architecture are stateless. Both the server and the client can understand any message received, even without seeing previous messages.
   - Requests
      - Request type. There are only use 4 basic HTTP verbs to interact with resources in `REST` system: `GET`, `POST`, `PUT` and `DELETE`
      - Headers. In the header of the request, there is a field called `Accept`, it indicated the type of content that client is able to receive from the server. `Accept` field consist of a `type` and a `subtype`  which are separated by a slash (/), such as `text/plain` and `application/json`
      - Path. paths should be simple to read and easy to understand. When referring to a specific resource, it is necessary to add an `id` in request path
   - Responses
      - Content-Type. Servers must include a `content-type` in the header of the response, indicating the type of data it is sending in the response body. The `content-type` in the response should be one of the options in the `accept` field of the request.
      - Response Code. Status Code. GET (200 means OK); POST (201 means CREATED); PUT (200 means OK); DELETE (204 means NO CONTENT)
