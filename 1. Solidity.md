## Notes of Solidity Lessons

#### Lesson 1: Basic Concepts (Making the Zombie Factory)

1. declaration the version

   ```solidity
   pragma solidity >=0.5.0 <0.6.0;
   pragma solidity ^0.4.9;
   ```

2. State Type

   - `unit` (`unit256`), `uint64`, `uint8`, etc.
   - Solidity reserves 256 bits of storage regardless of the `uint` size, but we can use uints organized by `struct` to compress the storage space.

3. Math Operation

   -  +, -, *, /, %, **

4. Structs

   ```solidity
   struct Person {
     uint age;
     string name;
   }
   ```

5. Arrays

   - Declare fixed arrays

     ```solidity
     uint[2] fixedArray;
     ```

   - Declare dynamic arrays

     ```solidity
     uint[] dynamicArray;
     ```

   - Declare a public array of struct

     ```so
     Person[] public people;
     ```

   - Add new elements to array and get the length of new array

     ```solidity
     length = array.push(element)
     ```

6. declare functions and parameters

   - public functions; parameter passed by reference

     ```solidity
     function eatHamburgers(string memory _name, uint _amount) public {}
     ```

   - private functions: only other functions within our contract can call this function

     ```solidity
     // start private func names with '_'
     function _addToArray(uint _number) private {}
     ```

   - view functions: only view the data but not modifying it

     ```solidity
     function sayHello() public view returns (string memory) {
       return 'xxx';
     }
     ```

   - pure functions: not access any data and the return value depends on params

     ```solidity
     function _multiply(uint a, uint b) private pure returns (uint) {
       return a * b;
     }
     ```

7. `Keccak256` hash function

   - `keccak256` expects a single parameter of type bytes

   - Use `abi.encodePacked()` to pack parameters

     ```solidity
     keccak256(abi.encodePacked("aaaab"));
     // return 6e91ec6b618bb462a4a6ee5aa2cb0e9cf30f7a052bb467b0ba58b8748c00d2e5
     ```

8.  Typecasting

   ```solidity
   // convert uint to uint8
   uint a = 8;
   uint8(a);
   ```

9. Events

   - declare and custom an event with keyword `event`
   - fire the event with keyword `emit`

   ```solidity
   // declare event
   event IntegersAdded(uint x, uint y, uint result);
   // fire event
   emit IntegersAdded(_x, _y, result);
   // front-end can listen for the event
   ```

#### Lesson 2: Further concepts (Zombies Attack Their Victims)

1. Mapping

   ```solidity
   // key-value
   mapping (address => uint) public accountBalance;
   ```

2. `msg.sender` is a certain global variables refers to the `address` of the external caller of the current function.

3. The `require`

   - `require` is used to check the condition expression

   - similar to `assert`

     ```solidity
     // Throws an error and exits if the condition expression is false
     // Solidity doesn't have string comparison, so compare strings with keccak256
     require(keccak256(abi.encodePacked(_name)) == keccak256(abi.encodePacked("Vitalik")));
     ```

4. Inheritance

   - Keyword: `is`

     ```solidity
     contract Base {}
     contract SubBase is Base {}
     ```

5. Import Other Filles

   - Keyword: `import`

     ```solidity
     // use path of other files to import
     import "./someothercontract.sol";
     ```

6. Store Variables

   - `memory` is temporary

   - `storage` is permanent

     ```solidity
     Sandwich[] sandwiches;
     function func(){
     	// mySandwich is a point. It will permanently change sandwiches[_index]
         Sandwich storage mySandwich = sandwiches[_index];
         mySandwich.status = "Eaten!";
         // anotherSandwich is just a copy. It won't affect sandwiches[_index + 1]
         Sandwich memory anotherSandwich = sandwiches[_index + 1];
         anotherSandwich.status = "Eaten!";
     }
     ```

7. Function Visibility

   - `private`: only functions within the same contract can call this function.
   - `internal`: `private` + functions within contracts inherit from this contract.
   - `external`: similar to `public`, except that `external`functions can ONLY be called by other functions outside the contract.
   - `public`: can be called anywhere, both internally and externally.

8. Interface

   ```solidity
   // Declaring an inferface looks like defining a contract
   contract NumberInterface {
     function getNum(address _myAddress) public view returns (uint);
   }
   // the address of the contract of getNum()
   address NumberInterfaceAddress = 0xab38... 
   // numberContract points to the contract of getNum()
   NumberInterface numberContract = NumberInterface(NumberInterfaceAddress);
   // call getNum() through inferface
   numberContract.getNum(msg.sender);
   ```

9. Multiple Return Values and return bool result

   ```solidity
   // return: return (1, 2, 3);
   // return bool result: return (_zombie.readyTime <= now);
   // get return values: (a, b, c) = multipleReturns();
   // get part of return values: (,,c) = multipleReturns();
   ```

#### Lesson 3: Advanced Solidity Concepts

1. Security Issues

   - Refer to contract `Ownable`, which protects core functions by modifier `onlyOwner`

   ```solidity
   contract Ownable {
   	// constructor() is a special function having the same name as the contract
   	constructor() internal {...}
   	// function modifier looks just like a function, but uses the keyword modifier instead of the keyword function
   	modifier onlyOwner() {...}
   	// use modifier to limit access of function. When renounceOwnership() is called, the code inside onlyOwner executes first. If the caller pass through the quick check in onlyOwner, then the caller can countinue to access the function.
   	function renounceOwnership() public onlyOwner {...}
   }
   ```

2. Gas and Gas Optimization

   - Users have to pay `gas` every time they execute a function on DApps. Users buy `gas` with `Ether` to execute functions on DApps. (Operations on blockchain is The creators of Ethereum wanted to make sure someone couldn't clog up the network with an infinite loop, or hog all the network resources with really intensive computations. So they made it so transactions aren't free, and users have to pay for computation time as well as storage.)
   - The `gas coast` of executing a function depends on the complexity of function's logic. Each individual operation has a `gas coast` based roughly on how much computing resources will be required to perform that operation (e.g. writing to storage is much more expensive than adding two integers). The total `gas cost` of function is the sum of the gas costs of all its individual operations.
   - Therefore, code optimization is particularly important to reduce users' expenses.
   - `view` functions don't actually change anything on the blockchain and thus don't cost any gas when they're called externally (still costs gas when called internally), which can be used to save gas.
   - Operations on `storage` are expensive. We should try to use `memory` except when absolutely necessary. <u>Memory arrays</u> must be created with a length argument. `uint[] memory values = new uint[](3);`

3. Time Units

   - Keywords: now (uint256), seconds, minutes, hours, days, weeks, years (not recommended)
   - `1 == 1 seconds`, `1 minutes == 60 seconds` 

4. Optimization: Passing Structs as Arguments

   - pass a reference into a function instead of passing in an ID and looking it up.

5. Function Modifier

   - Function modifier looks just like a function, but uses the keyword modifier instead of the keyword function

   - Function modifiers can also take arguments. 

     ```solidity
     modifier olderThan(uint _age, uint _userId) {
       require(age[_userId] >= _age);
       _;
     }
     ```

   - Use the last line of the modifier call the rest of the function with `_;`.

6. Loops Statement

   ```solidity
   // similar to javascript...
   for(uint i = 0; i < 3; i++){
   	//...
   }
   ```

7. Conditional Statement

   ```sol
   // similar to javascript...
   if (zombieCoins[msg.sender] > 100000000) {
     // ...
   } else {
     // ...
   }
   ```

#### Lesson 4: Payable Functions and DApps 

1. Recap: Function Modifiers

   - Visibility Modifiers: `private`, `internal`, `external` and `public`.

   - State Modifiers

     - `view`: only view the data but not modifying it
     - `pure`: neither view data on blockchain nor modify them
     - `view` and `pure` cost no gas to call if they're called externally from outside the contract

   - Custom Modifiers

     - Refer to `onlyOwner` and `aboveLevel` in Lesson 3

   - These modifiers can all be stacked together on a function definition

     ```solidity
     function test() external view onlyOwner anotherModifier {...}
     ```

2. The `payable` Modifier

   - With `payable`, it's possible to call a function and pay money to the contract owning that function at the same time.

   - The sender specifies how much `ether` to send with `value`, and the function see how much `ether` sent by `msg.value`.

     ```solidity
     //sender
     OnlineStore.buySomething({from: someOne, value: web3.utils.toWei(0.001)})
     // receiver
     contract OnlineStore {
       function buySomething() external payable {
         // Check to make sure 0.001 ether was sent to the function call:
         require(msg.value == 0.001 ether);
         transferThing(msg.sender);
       }
     }
     ```

3. Withdraw and payable address

   - We can only transfer ETH to a payable address
   - `address(this).balance` is the total balance stored on the contract
   - Contract can call sender's `transfer()` method to withdraw ETH

4. Random Numbers

   - Use `keccak256` hash function, `now` timestamp and incrementing `nonce` to create random numbers. 
   - The method above of random numbers generation is unsafe. Other safer methods of generating random numbers: to be further studied.
